## About Me
I am a data science researcher with experience in both the industry and academia, specializing in affective computing. My research primarily concentrates on emotion processing using facial cues and physiological signals. I am eager to advance in the fields of technology, research, and development, aiming to make a significant impact in the digital era.

## Area of Interest
Affective Computing, Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science domains like Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Generative Models.

## Research Publications
* Published a patent - A Walking Stick incorporating human emotion recognition techniques - Official Journal of The Patent Office, India
* A distributed ensemble machine learning technique for emotion classification from vocal cues, in the 10th International Conference on Big Data Analytics(BDA2022), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol13773. Springer - Publication Link
* Precision-Based Weighted Blending DistributedEnsemble Model for Emotion Classification. Algorithms2022. - Publication Link
## Research Experience
Built a prototype of the device currently under going modifications to enhance its capability in capturing human emotions. Developed and implemented models capable of detecting emotions from images and videos. Conducted an extensive literature review focusing on the processing of emotions through visual cues and physiological signals.
